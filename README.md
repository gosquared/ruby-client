## GoSquared Ruby Gem

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gosquared/ruby-client.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gosquared/ruby-gem)

**Please feel free to open an issue if you find anything not working, or to leave feedback for improvement. You can also get in touch directly: russell@gosquared.com**

This gems works with the [GoSquared API](https://www.gosquared.com/docs/api/), You can use it for both fetching metrics from your GoSquared account and also posting new events and contacts.

**Note:** if you are looking to set up GoSquared for the first time and install Analytics, People CRM and Live Chat within a Rails app,  you can do so by using our [GoSquared-Rails gem]
(https://github.com/gosquared/gosquared-rails)

All functions listed in the API documentation are methods you can call on the GoSquared class.

You can generate an API key from your [GoSquared Account Settings](https://www.gosquared.com/settings/api).


#Installation

```ruby
gem install gosquared
```

Then require GoSquared in your application

```ruby
require 'gosquared'
```

#Tracking API
This is for sending data to GoSquared. It allows you to track:
* Events
* Transactions
* People profiles

##Track Events
```ruby

gs = Gosquared::RubyLibrary.new("your_API_key","your_project_token")

gs.tracking.event({ event: { name: 'event' } })

#builds the url to the 'GoSquared Tracking' endpoint with the "events" dimension and an event to add to the events list

gs.tracking.post

#posts the data to the 'GoSquared Tracking' endpoint

Response Message: OK
=> #<Net::HTTPOK 200 OK readbody=true>

```

##Track Transactions

```ruby
gs = Gosquared::RubyLibrary.new("your_API_key","your_project_token")

gs.tracking.transaction({
  transaction: { id: "1", revenue: 50, quantity: 1,
  previous_transaction_timestamp: Time.new }
  })

gs.tracking.post

Response Message: OK
=> #<Net::HTTPOK 200 OK readbody=true>
```

##Create or Update People profiles

This method is useful for importing existing user profiles into GoSquared people and updating profiles you have already added.

It's highly recommended that you also implement the front end [javascript 'identify' method](https://www.gosquared.com/docs/api/javascript-tracking-code/identify-users) on your site. This enables us to track a the user's session activity and browser information against their People profile.

We also recommend using an email address for the `person_id`. To do this, the email address needs to be prefixed with `email:` like in the example below.

```ruby
gs = Gosquared::RubyLibrary.new("your_API_key","your_project_token")

gs.tracking.identify({
  person_id: "email:user@test.com", # Required

  # Reserved property names
  properties: {
    name: "Test User",
    username: "testuser",
    phone: "+44123456789",
    created_at:"2016-06-07T15:44:20Z", # ISO 8601 formatted String
    company_name:"GoSquared",
    company_industry:"Customer Analytics",
    company_size: 15000,

    # Custom properties
    custom: {
      # custom_property_name: "custom property value"  # You can track as many custom properties as you like
    }
  }
})

gs.tracking.post

Response Message: OK
=> #<Net::HTTPOK 200 OK readbody=true>
```


#Reporting API
This is for pulling data from your GoSquared account. It is split into 3 sections;
* Now - realtime data
* Trends â€“ historical data (includes ecommerce)
* People - user data
* Account - administration

##Now
The Now API provides real-time concurrent information about your sites and apps, such as the number of concurrent visitors online, the most popular pages right now, the most influential traffic sources, and much more.

_Now Example:_

```ruby
gs = Gosquared::RubyLibrary.new("your_API_key","your_project_token")

#instantiates new GoSquared object

gs.now.concurrents

#builds the url to the 'GoSquared Now' endpoint with the "Concurrents dimension"

gs.now.fetch

#fetches the data from the 'GoSquared Now' endpoint

=> {"visitors"=>3, "returning"=>1, "pages"=>0, "active"=>0, "tagged"=>0}
```

##Trends
The Trends API provides historical analytics information for any given period in a project's history. The data for the current period updates in real-time, so the figures are always fresh and up-to-date.

_Trends Example:_

```ruby
gs = Gosquared::RubyLibrary.new("your_API_key","your_project_token")

gs.trends.browser.from('2016-06-30').to('2016-07-07')

#builds the url to the 'GoSquared Trends' endpoint with the "Trends dimension" and date filters

gs.trends.fetch

#fetches the filtered data from the 'GoSquared Trends' endpoint

=> {"list"=>[{"id"=>"chrome", "browser"=>"chrome", "name"=>"Chrome", "metrics"=>{"visits"=>3}}], "cardinality"=>1, "dimension"=>"browser", "range"=>{"from"=>"2016-06-30T00:00:00+01:00", "to"=>"2016-07-07T23:59:59+01:00"}, "interval"=>"day"}

```

##People


```ruby

gs = Gosquared::RubyLibrary.new("your_API_key","your_project_token")

gs.people.smartgroups

#builds the url to the 'GoSquared People' endpoint with the "people" dimension.

gs.people.fetch

#fetches all smartgroups associated with the account.

```

##Account
The Account API allows you to perform administrative actions against GoSquared accounts. This includes actions like changing settings, configuration, and listing resources under the account.

_Account Example:_

```ruby

gs = Gosquared::RubyLibrary.new("your_API_key","your_project_token")

gs.account.blocked.ips.ip('5.10.148.50')

#builds the url to the 'GoSquared Account' endpoint with the "Blocked dimension" and ip address to add to the blocked list

gs.account.post

#posts the data to the 'GoSquared Account' endpoint

Response Message: OK
=> #<Net::HTTPOK 200 OK readbody=true>

gs.account.sites.token("your_site_token")

#builds the url to the 'GoSquared Account' endpoint with the "Sites" dimension and token you want to retrieve the site by.

gs.account.sites.fetch

```

#Tests

```ruby
rspec
```
